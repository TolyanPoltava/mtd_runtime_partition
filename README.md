# mtd_runtime_partition
Some old code I wrote a few years ago to resize MTD partitions on an embedded system while Linux is running. 

It is based off of Linux MTD Utils `http://www.linux-mtd.infradead.org/`

I used the following links as a starting point:
* http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.drivers.mtd/30949
* http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.drivers.mtd/30950
* http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.drivers.mtd/30951



**Note:** I am no longer maintaining this, just posting it in case anyone is trying to tackle a similar issue.
